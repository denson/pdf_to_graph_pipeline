      "high_dimensionality": "Modeling obstacles such as sparse data, overfitting, and the curse of dimensionality are common, necessitating feature selection to reduce dimensionality.",

      "filter_methods": "Model-independent, utilize statistical tests and model-agnostic measures, are fast but often limited by assumptions and data requirements.",

    "core_objectives": "To introduce powershap, a novel wrapper feature selection method that combines statistical hypothesis testing and power calculations with Shapley values to perform quick and intuitive feature selection.",
    "methods": "Powershap uses Shapley values to quantify the prediction impact of features, comparing these against a known random feature using statistical tests to identify informative features. An automatic tuning mode optimizes model hyperparameters without user input.",
    "key_findings": "Powershap outperforms traditional filter methods and achieves comparable predictive performance to wrapper methods, while being significantly faster, sometimes achieving execution times that are half or a third of those required by comparable methods.",
    "additional_details": "Powershap is implemented as an open-source sklearn component, accessible for integration into standard data science workflows. It also features an automatic mode for parameter optimization."

  "abstract": "The study investigates the utility of hypnopompic heart rate variability (HRV) for predicting cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in 2217 subjects. Short-term prediction using HRV metrics shows a high accuracy of 81.4%. Entropy-based indices are particularly significant in prediction models.",

  "limitations": {
    "small_sample_size": "The short-term prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes was based on a small sample size, with only 70 participants having a CVD event within two years.",
    "under_sampling": "The study used under-sampling to balance the dataset for short-term prediction due to class imbalance, which could affect the generalizability of the results.",
    "generalizability": "The study was conducted on a specific cohort from the Sleep Heart Health Study, which may limit the applicability of the findings to other populations.",
    "data_availability": "There might have been limitations related to the availability and quality of the data selected from the open access database used in the research.",
    "confounding_factors": "Potential confounding factors such as medication use or other individual health conditions not fully accounted for could have impacted results.",
    "technology_reliance": "The prediction models heavily relied on machine learning algorithms, which may be sensitive to changes in data quality and availability.",
    "long_term_prediction": "The study also noted slight performance limitations in long-term prediction models compared to short-term predictions.",
    "alternative_approaches": "It suggested further study or alternative approaches, such as the application of more advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning, for cross-validation."

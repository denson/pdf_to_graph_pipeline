        "description": "The linear model (LM) exhibited competitive prediction power for integrated sap flow over machine learning models like random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBM), and neural networks (NN). The LM maintained systematic bias leading to better cumulative prediction, especially with a one-hour shift of global radiation."

    "comparison": "The study finds that importance-based feature selection methods generally outperform SHAP-value-based methods in model performance for fraud detection.",
    "effectiveness": "Importance-based methods using built-in feature importance lists are more efficient, especially for larger datasets, as they involve less computational effort compared to SHAP.",
    "classifier_performance": "Random Forest demonstrated the best performance among classifiers, while Decision Tree showed relatively poorer performance.",
    "feature_subset": "Features selected by importance-based methods often yield better results in AUPRC, particularly notable in XGBoost and CatBoost models for feature subset sizes of 3 and 10, respectively."

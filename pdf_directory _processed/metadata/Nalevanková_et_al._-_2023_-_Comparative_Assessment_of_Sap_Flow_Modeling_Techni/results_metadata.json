      "Linear models demonstrated high prediction power for sap flow in European beech trees, particularly when the global radiation was shifted by one hour.",
      "Linear models provided comparable prediction power to Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBM); however, Neural Networks (NN) displayed relatively poor prediction power.",
      "Machine learning models like RF and XGBM performed better in drier conditions compared to linear models.",
      "Linear models had enhanced performance in wetter conditions compared to machine learning models.",
      "Data manipulation, such as shifting global radiation values, had varying impacts on model performance."

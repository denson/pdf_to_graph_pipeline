    "introduction": "The study compares sap flow modeling techniques in European Beech trees using linear models, random forests, extreme gradient boosting, and neural networks over a five-year dataset.",
    "key_findings": "Linear models provide comparable prediction accuracy to complex models (RF, XGBM, NN) and can efficiently estimate long-term integrated sap flow with less computational effort.",

      "analysis": "Six variants of datasets with different input ranges and conditions were used to model sap flow."
    },
    "results": {
      "LM": "Had the maximum prediction power when shifted by 1 hour of global radiation.",
      "NN": "Exhibited relatively poor prediction power compared to other machine learning models.",
      "RF and XGBM": "Performed comparably well to LM except in drier conditions."
    },
    "conclusion": "Simpler linear models can be as effective as more complex machine learning models for modeling cumulative sap flow over longer periods, providing a practical and computationally efficient alternative."

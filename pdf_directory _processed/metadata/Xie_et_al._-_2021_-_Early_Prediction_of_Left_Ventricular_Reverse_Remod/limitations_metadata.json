    "The study is a single-center and retrospective study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.",
    "There is a need for a larger sample prospective study and external validation to provide stronger evidence.",
    "The study focused on predictive performance rather than statistical inference, so no conclusions can be drawn about risk factors.",
    "Compared to linear models, tree-based models may exhibit unexplainable feature mechanisms, complicating interpretation."

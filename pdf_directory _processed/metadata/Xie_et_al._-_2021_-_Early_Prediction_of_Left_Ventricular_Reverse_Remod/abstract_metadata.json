  "title": "Early Prediction of Left Ventricular Reverse Remodeling in First-Diagnosed Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy: A Comparison of Linear Model, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting",
  "abstract": {
    "core_objectives": "To develop an early predictive model for left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR) in patients with first-diagnosed idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) using clinical and echocardiographic data.",
    "methods": "A single-center study was conducted including 104 patients with idiopathic DCM. Models like logistic regression, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were implemented with a 10-fold cross-validated model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots were used for performance evaluation.",
    "key_findings": "LVRR occurred in 45.2% of patients after optimal treatment. The XGBoost model outperformed logistic regression with an AU-ROC of 0.8205 versus 0.5909. Important features for prediction included cystatin C, right ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The tree-based models showed better accuracy in predicting LVRR, aiding in the early identification of non-responders to therapy."

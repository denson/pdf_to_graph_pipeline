  "limitations": [
    "The study's dataset size is small which impacts the performance of the deep learning models, as they require large datasets for effective training.",
    "Texture features alone were found to be insufficient for predicting true labels effectively, indicating that they may not provide enough discriminatory power without other features in small datasets.",
    "The performance of deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, and RestNet was suboptimal compared to the optimized Random Forest model, likely due to the small dataset.",
    "A comparison with other heavy datasets and different feature selection methods was not exhaustively conducted.",
    "The study primarily focuses on optimizing a specific machine learning model (Random Forest), which might not capture the potential of other advanced machine learning or deep learning techniques."

    "criticisms": "The paper challenges the appropriateness of using Shapley values for feature selection by highlighting potential misalignments between the axioms' implications and feature selection goals.",
    "objective": "To scrutinize the reliance on axioms (like fairness) in feature attribution and to assess how these axioms might affect the suitability of Shapley values in feature selection contexts.",
    "remarks": "The study suggests that while the Shapley values adhere to certain principles viewed as fair, their suitability and interpretative power in feature selection still depend heavily on the specific game formulation."

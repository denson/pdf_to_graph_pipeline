    "aims": [
      "To clarify limitations around the use of Shapley values for feature selection in the literature.",
      "To help demystify certain aspects of the Shapley value axioms viewed as 'favourable'.",
      "To analyze when Shapley value axioms do not provide a guarantee that the Shapley value is suited to feature selection."

    "scope": [
      "The study uses simple, abstract 'toy' counterexamples and concrete simulation settings.",
      "To investigate a variety of Shapley value formulations such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Shapley Additive Global importancE (SAGE).",
      "To consider the implications of Shapley value axioms and game formulations on feature selection."
